Hey,This is ROb.

00:00:2,333-->00:00:4,233
Yesterday he went for a ride.

3
00:00:6,233-->00:00:7,833
Unfortunately Rob met with an accident .

4
00:00:8,233-->00:00:10,233
He got escaped but not his car.

5
00:00:13,233-->00:00:17,233
So,he planned to claim insurance for his car.

6
00:00:19,233-->00:00:22,233
For that Rob went to police station to file FIR.

7
00:00:24,233-->00:00:25,633
Next he went to carshowroom


8
00:00:26,233-->00:00:28,233
 to get the estimation of the replacement to be done.
 

9
00:00:29,233-->00:00:31,233
Finally he went to insurance office.

10
00:00:32,233-->00:00:34,103
to submit the estimation copy and claim insurance.

11
00:00:35,233-->00:00:38,233
Loss of his car and this legal formalities made Rob more frustrated.

12
00:00:41,233-->00:00:42,733
To overcome this we introduce a project
